<RULES>
You have to work on the following tasks but to do so you MUST follow these developpemnts rules.
1. You MUST make atomic commit during all the dev process. Follow strictly the conventionnal commit conventions: @https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ 
2. You MUST refactor the entire codebase by following the SOLID princilples: @https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/ 
3. You MUST act with the mindset of uncle Bob!!!
4. You MUST follow an agile workflow (@https://asana.com/fr/resources/agile-methodology). It means that, you have to write code, test it and refactor it iteratively in order to write the cleanest code possible.
